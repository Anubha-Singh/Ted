<h1>The Infinity War</h1>
<p class="blog">NO, its not just in comics now. 
People, We are talking about the constant skirmishes that we battle within ourselves each day. The countless constellations of thoughts, the midnight conversations with our own individuality and many more. Those endless combats! 
This is about time to acknowledge them all and delve deeper into the multitude of realms they pose.

But wait, we announce that it's high time to calm your nerves down, to get your senses buckled up and let the spark in you be invigorated as BIT Sindri, one of the oldest and premium technical institution of India, is geared up to launch its very first TEDx talk, the theme being- "The Infinity War".

Could there be a more enrapturing theme for the fanatical crowd at campus?

With eminent speakers on the board, it promises to bring forward life-changing ideas by offering insights into the lives of people who successfully directed a path of glory by vanquishing their respective wars.

Let's live the Infinity war!</p>
